# The Assumptions We Don't See

Most of our daily decisions are guided by beliefs we've never consciously examined. These assumptions operate like invisible software, running in the background of our minds.

## What Are Hidden Assumptions?

Hidden assumptions are beliefs we hold so deeply that we don't recognize them as beliefs at all. They feel like facts about the world.

## Common Hidden Assumptions

- "Success means being busy"
- "Love requires sacrifice of the self"
- "Security comes from external validation"
- "Conflict is always destructive"

## The Practice of Assumption-Hunting

In philosophical counseling, we develop the skill of assumption-huntingâ€”learning to notice and question the beliefs that unconsciously guide our choices.

This isn't about finding the "right" beliefs, but about making our beliefs conscious so we can choose them deliberately.
