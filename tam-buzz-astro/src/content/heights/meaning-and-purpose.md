# Finding Meaning in Life's Questions

When we ask "What's the point?" we're engaging in one of humanity's oldest philosophical inquiries. This question isn't a sign of depression or failure—it's a sign of depth.

## The Nature of Meaning

Meaning isn't something we find like a lost object. It's something we create through our choices, relationships, and commitments.

## Practical Philosophy

In our sessions, we explore:

- What gives your life significance?
- How do you want to be remembered?
- What legacy do you want to leave?

These aren't abstract questions—they're practical tools for living with intention.
